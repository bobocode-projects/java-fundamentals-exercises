Build strong fundamental skills that you will need for real-world Enterprise Java development

## Why
Most people don’t know how to learn Enterprise Java efficiently. So we created an **open-source education system**
that helps them to **master strong skills**, learn **world best practices** and build a **successful career**. 🚀

At Bobocode we have extensive experience in both building Enterprise Java applications and organizing efficient learning.
Therefore, this course covers what you need in the most efficient way. We believe that
**the key to efficient learning is practice**. 💪 And as a software engineer, you should **spend as much time as you can in the IDE writing code**.
At the end of the day, this is the only place where you build software... 💻

## About the course
Java Standard Edition is huge. Computer Science is huge. Object-Oriented programming, as well as Functional programming, 
are also pretty big topics. So how can you learn everything you need and **don't get stuck for years learning fundamentals only?** 🤔 
You're in the right place to find the answer. 😀

This course gives you two uniques features that will help you to master fundamentals ASAP:
1. It consists of **selected topics that are must-have** for real-world enterprise Java development ⭐️
2. It is fully based on **special training exercises** that put your practice on rails and **boost up your learning efficiency** 🚀
