Improve your functional programming skills implementing various operations based on a integer stream of Prime Numbers

### Pre-conditions ❗
You're supposed to be familiar with Lambdas, Stream API and Optional API

### Objectives
* create an **infinite sream** of integers with a **custom increment**
* **find matching elements** within a stream
* **limit** the number of elements within a stream
* **calculate a sum** of elements of an `IntStream`
* transform a stream of primitives into a stream of `Integer` objects ("**Stream boxing**")
