/**
 * Welcome! This is an introduction class that will show you a simple example of Bobocode exercise.
 * <p>
 * JavaDoc is a way of communication with other developers. We use Java Docs in every exercise in order to help you
 * understand how to implement each method. So PLEASE MAKE SURE you read the Java Doc when start implementing a method.
 * <p>
 * Every exercise is covered with tests. So when you're implementing some class like {@link Introduction}, you should
 * also be able to find a corresponding class like {@link //IntroductionTest}.
 * <p>
 * Throughout the course you will need to implement hundreds of methods. And this is a simple example of how it's all
 * organized. You read the Java Doc, implement a method and run the test.
