Learn tree data structures and build strong skills implementing binary search tree using recursion 💪

### Pre-conditions ❗️
* You're supposed to be familiar with trees like [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)
* You should understand the [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science))

### Objectives

* **insert  an element** to the tree using recursion ✅
* **search an element** in the tree ✅
* **traverse tree elements** in a ascending order ✅
* calculate tree **depth** ✅
* maintain tree **size** ✅
